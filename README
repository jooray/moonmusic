Usage
-----

ENTER stores and analyses the image coming from default camera

!, @, # (Shift-1, Shift-2, Shift-3 on US keyboard) loads the analyzed image
to layer 1, 2, 3

1, 2, 3 toggles playing of the particular layer (it always plays from the
start, think about it when timing the run)

keys z,x,c,...,< (lower part of US keyboard) control b/w threshold

Key a toggles b/w and grayscale modes

"i" toggles invert
