Installation
------------

Download and install arss, open this sketch in Processing.org,
install Minim (may be already part of your Processing distribution),
fullscreen.

We switched to OpenCV from processing.video for webcam capture,
because processing.video does not work under Linux. You have
two options: install OpenCV on any platform or edit the source
and change according to comments (Processing capture parts
are marked and commented, you need to comment out OpenCV parts.
Sadly, processing nor java have preprocessor, so apart from maintaining
two branches, there is no way to switch it easily).

Run and enjoy

Usage
-----

ENTER stores and analyses the image coming from default camera

!, @, # (Shift-1, Shift-2, Shift-3 on US keyboard) loads the analyzed image
to layer 1, 2, 3

1, 2, 3 toggles playing of the particular layer (it always plays from the
start, think about it when timing the run)

keys z,x,c,...,< (lower part of US keyboard) control b/w threshold

Key a toggles b/w and grayscale modes

"i" toggles invert
